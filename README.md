When using NixEditor Unstable, please place the script into /bin under your home folder for the intended experience.

Issues will occur! (if not obvious already) Make sure to report issues, as well as any fixes/optimizations, I'm new to shell scripts, help me out, you help everyone out.

Make sure git is added to your config file or the editor will not be able to receive the the NixOS-Editor extras, this can be bypassed by placing the folders in /home/relo/NixEditor/Tools/, but git is recommended
